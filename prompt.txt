Build a web app called AI Study Buddy – Flashcard Generator for the Vibe Coding 3.0 Hackathon, aligned with SDG 4: Quality Education.

Core Features:

Flashcard Generator

Users paste study notes or text.

Backend (Flask + Python) sends text to the Hugging Face Question-Answering API.

Frontend (HTML, CSS animations, JavaScript) dynamically creates interactive flip-style flashcards.

Store flashcards in MySQL for future reuse.

Suggestion Box

Students can drop suggestions/feedback.

All students who submitted suggestions should receive a confirmation email at once (bulk email feature).

Authentication System

Signup and Login pages with username/email + password.

Session management to ensure personalized flashcards and suggestions tracking.

Judging Criteria to Keep in Mind:

Technical Creativity & Flow → Original use of AI + flashcards.

UI/UX Design → Simple but appealing card flip design and easy navigation.

Prototyping & Execution → Rapid build with Flask routes, API integration, and MySQL models.

Problem Clarity & Solution Quality → Solve a real student problem: quick flashcard generation from notes.

Market Insight → Target African student community, scalable with IntaSend for future monetization.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (flip animations).

Backend: Python Flask + MySQL.

AI Integration: Hugging Face QA API.

Emailing: Flask-Mail or similar package to send bulk confirmation emails.

Payments (optional future monetization): IntaSend API.
